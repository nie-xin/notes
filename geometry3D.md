Euclidean geometry: 2 parallel lines never meet. But in fact, the parallel lines meet at infinity.

So we can change the Euclidean plane by adding these points ar infinity - "ideal points". 

By adding these points, the Euclidean space is transfered into the projective space.

###Coordinates
In Euclidean 2D, points are represented by (x, y). By adding an extra coordinate to this pair (x, y, 1), we celcare to represent the same point. We can go back and forward by adding or remving the last coordinate.

(2x, 2y, 2) or (kx, ky, k) (non-zero value k) represents the same point. So two triples are equivalent when they differ by a common multiple. These are called homogeneous coordinates of the point.

The points at infinity are represented by homogeneous coordinates in which the last coordinate is 0, like (x, y, 0).
