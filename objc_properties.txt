Instance variable to be pointer to other objects:
- object-type attribute: a pointer to simple object linke NSString
- to-one relationships: a pointer to a single complex object
- to-many relationships: a ponter to an instance of a collection class

Object ownership
- an object has an object instance
- the object with the pointer own the object that is being pointed to
- when an object has 0 owner, it will be deallocated

NSObject - dealloc
- will be executed when instance deallocated

To build program (not to run): Command-B
- testing code with syntax check

Collections & ownership:
- when an object adds to collection, the collection established a pointer to the object, so the object has an owner
- when an object is removed from the collection, the collection gets rid of its pointer to this object, and this object loses an owner
